# Realistic image classification
This repository show my take on the kaggle competition Realistic image classification, hosted as part of my second year Machine Learning course, in which I placed second in my year. The competition consisted in training a classification model on a data set containing images generated by deep generative models. My solution consisted in an ensemble model, containg multiple CNNs and residual CNNs (inspired by ResNet), all of them designed and trained from scratch. As well I experimented with multiple types of data augmentation techniques to further better the accuracy of my models.

## Key takeaways
This project taught me a lot about CNNs and residual CNNs, from how they work to how design a good CNN architecture and how to train them. I also learned a lot about data augmentation and how to balance it in order to not overfit the model. Another area of improvement is my knowledge of NN layers, I learned why and where to use Dropout, Batch normalization and Pooling layers, how they can help or hurt my model.
